	<p>Hello, this is a pet (demonstrative) site of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oleksandr-gralievskyi-46301517a/?originalSubdomain=ua">Gralevskyi Oleksandr.</a></p>
	<p>As for me the fastest way to learn foreign lexicon is learning the most frequently used words in sphere you are interested in. 
	<p>
		And this site can help you in such approach. You can take any text you are interested in and parse it into words. 
		In the result of parsing you receive a number of times a word is occured in the text. 
		You can save your result of parsing and after that delete unnecessary words. 
		In such way you can form lists of words for learning.

	<p>The back end (server) site was created using Java 8 and Spring framework. The code is on <a href="https://github.com/Gralevskyi/TextParser">git hub.</a></p>
	<p>The front end is running using angular js. The code is also located on <a href="https://github.com/Gralevskyi/TextParserFront">git hub.</a></p>
	<p>I'm looking for job of java developing and you can find my portfolio on appropriate <a href="https://gralievskyi-cv.herokuapp.com/">site</a> or look through my accont on
